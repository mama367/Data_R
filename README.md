# White House Briefing Text Analysis in R

# Overview
This script presents a complete workflow for scraping White House press briefings, extracting textual content, and conducting political text analysis. It includes web scraping, tokenization, word-frequency exploration, topic modeling (STM), and co-occurrence network analysis. The code illustrates how large-scale political communication data can be collected and analyzed for understanding patterns in presidential messaging.
